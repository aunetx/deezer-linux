# Contributing to Deezer Linux

Thank you for considering contributing to the unofficial Deezer Linux port! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Before creating an issue, please check if it hasn't been reported already
- Use the issue template if available
- Include detailed steps to reproduce the bug
- Specify your system information (OS, architecture, package type)

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Use clear and descriptive titles
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Build one or more packages
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: Add some feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request
8. Provide information about the changes made and the packages built and manually tested

### Build Requirements

Ensure you have all required dependencies:

- Node.js (20 recommended)
- npm
- 7z
- make
- wget

## Development Setup

```sh
make install_deps
```

## Patching

### Creating a Patch

To create a patch, clone the repository and run:

```sh
make patch-new
```

Edit the files you want to change in the `app` directory.

> [!TIP]
> You do not need to generate a patch file to test your changes. Open the `app` folder after running `make patch-new` and make your changes. Then run `make build_{target}_{arch}` to try your changes.

When you are done, commit your changes, and then generate the patch:

```sh
make patch-gen
```

The patch will be saved in the `patches` directory. Make sure to rename the patch file to something meaningful and follow the naming convention. Add the patch to the echoed list in the `Makefile`.

> [!TIP]
> If possible, you may want to add a switch to allow the users to use the feature you added or not. Do not forget to [mention it](./README.md#usage).

You can now try your patch by building and executing the package:

```sh
make build_{target}_{arch}
```

### Applying a Patch

To manually apply a patch, run:

```sh
apply -p1 -dapp < patches/{name}.patch
```

> [!NOTE]
> Deezer does not provide all the information needed to implement some features.
>
> Deezer provides:
>
> - Player state (playing, paused)
> - Track info (title, artist, album, cover URL)
> - Shuffle and repeat state
>
> Deezer does not provide:
>
> - Track duration
> - Track position
